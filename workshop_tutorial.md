# How to use AR in Unity
## Outline
In this workshop we're going to make a simple augmented reality (**AR**) application for your phone, to show the possiblities and applications of AR. We're going to use the game engine Unity, because it's cross-platform, easy to use and easy to set up for AR.

The goal of the workshop is to make an interactive AR experience. We'll go step by step through the content. if it goes too slow/fast for you: this is the document where you can skip ahead / fall back to.


## Learning outcomes
At the end of this workshop, you will be familiar with:
- The Unity engine
	- Creating a scene with objects
	- Basics of the engine and it's possibilities
	- Writing simple scripts
	- Building an application for an (android) phone
- The Vuforia AR plugin
	 - General setup in Unity
	 - It's possibilities

## Pre-requisites
**Some programming experience would be nice**  
But is not neccecary. You can do a lot without programming, making things move or look cool as in composition. But the interaction comes with programming, keep that in mind!

**Unity installed with the Vuforia plugin**  
this is done by installing downloading Unity [here](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal). During the setup process, you'll encounter a step called **Choose Components**, which looks like this:

You can uncheck everything except unity itself. After that, select either iOS or Android build support (depending on your phone), Windows or Mac build support (depending on your OS), and Vuforia.

## Overview
We'll go through the content in this order:
- **Introduction**
- **Vuforia setup in unity**  
After this point you can stop following the workshop if you're familiar with Unity
- **Unity tutorial**
- **Play around in unity with AR, getting a feeling for the engine**  
This is when you can ask your questions regarding anything unity related
- **Export to android phone**  
iOS users can do it as well, but they'll have to use an online tutorial since I haven't done it myself
- **Build your AR experience**
- **Showcase your app**  
And drink a beer together


but the implementation is totally up to you! Be creative and have fun!
